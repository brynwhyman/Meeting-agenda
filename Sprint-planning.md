# Sprint planning

## Overview of session

### Purpose

Sprint planning is an event where the team determines the stories in the Ready column that they will work on during the upcoming sprint and discusses their initial  plan for completing those stories.

We may establish a sprint goal and use that as a basis for determining how items from the Ready columns are selected to be included in the sprint.

As mentioned in the 'Scope' section, a core goal of the sprint planning session is ensuring that the team feels confident that all issues pulled in to the sprint can be  completed within the period. If team members do not feel confident, the sprint goal should be reviewed.

### Frequency

Sprint planning sessions are scheduled at a fortnightly interval, on the first day of a sprint.

## Who is involved

### Product owner

The product owner identifies the candidate issues in the Ready column and their relative priority, as well as proposes a sprint goal.

### Full team

The team determine how many issues from the Ready column they forecast they will be able to complete, and determine how they will deliver those issues.

Their forecast can be influenced by things like the story point velocity of previous sprints.

## Session structure

The sprint planning is typically split into two parts:

### Part 1 - Scope

The team selects which items from the prioritised Ready column they forecast they will be able to complete during the sprint. Agenda items to support this are:

1. If there is a sprint goal, use this as a decision filter to determine which issues to include in the sprint.
2. Who is available for this sprint? What holidays and other activities will impact everyone's availability.
3. What's the resulting capacity based on everyone's availability.
4. Choose the issues the team will include in the sprint based on the goal and team capacity.
5. Discuss how confident the team is that they'll be able to complete the selected issues and meet the goal.

### Part 2 - Plan

The team should discuss in more detail how they will deliver the selected issues.

* Does everyone know what they will pick up first?
* Are there related issues that will require people to link up?
* Will one issue lay the plan for another issue, so must be done first?
